This assignment has us create an application that can be used to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in a company so that a business can be organized. This application uses a Node.js backend to save and retrieve employee data from a mySQL database file.

As specified in the assignment, a user can add departments, roles, employees. They can also view departments, roles, and employees. A user can also update an employee's role. Now go keep track of those employees!
